    title: "The Blue Meth Connection",
    content:
      'In Season 2, Daryl rummages through Merle\'s drug stash and pulls out a bag of blue crystal meth — a direct reference to Breaking Bad\'s "Blue Sky." Vince Gilligan confirmed the shows exist in the same universe, suggesting Merle was one of Heisenberg\'s customers.',

  {
    title: "Glenn's Original Getaway Car",
    content:
      "The red Dodge Challenger Glenn drives in Season 1 is the same model used in multiple chase scenes throughout AMC programming. It was chosen specifically because its engine sound could be heard from blocks away — a terrible choice in a zombie apocalypse, which is exactly the point.",
  },
  {
    title: 'The "Sophia" Barn Reveal',
    content:
      "The Season 2 barn scene was filmed with most of the cast not knowing Sophia would emerge as a walker. The genuine shock on the actors' faces — especially Carol's breakdown — was partially real, as the reveal was kept secret even during rehearsals.",
  },
  {
    title: "Negan's Comic Book Kill Count",
    content:
      "In the comics, Negan's introduction is even more brutal. The show actually toned down several of his scenes. Jeffrey Dean Morgan has said he read the comics extensively and had to play a version that was 'about 60% of comic Negan' to keep it broadcastable.",
  },
  {
    title: "The Three Questions",
    content:
      'Rick\'s three questions — "How many walkers have you killed? How many people have you killed? Why?" — were improvised by Andrew Lincoln during filming. The writers loved them so much they became a recurring element throughout the series.',
  },
  {
    title: "Walker Extras Easter Egg",
    content:
      "Greg Nicotero, the show's makeup effects supervisor, appears as a walker in nearly every season. Finding him became a fan tradition, similar to spotting Stan Lee in Marvel films. He's estimated to have been zombified on screen over 30 times.",
